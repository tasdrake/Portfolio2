        <p>
          I am a recent graduate from CU Boulder, and a current student at Galvanize. I graduated from CU with a degree in environmental studies with an emphasis on energy and climate. During my last semester at CU I completed an internship at TerraLogic - an environmental engineering consulting firm.  During this time, I researched the use of drones for environmental applications along highways, and wrote a feasibility report that I presented to the Colorado Department of Transportation.  My report will be published in an engineering magazine in 2017.  When I finish at Galvanize in September, I will be looking for a job. I enjoy the environmental field, but I am interested in other tech related jobs as well.
